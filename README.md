# Object-Detection-Webapp
A coding challenge problem statement for GSoC 2020 under caMicroscope. It is a basic design for object detection using tfjs coco-ssd pretrained model.
## Getting Started
cd into the TFJS folder.
Install Dependencies:
'yarn'
Launch a development server, and watch files for changes. This command will also automatically open the demo app in your browser.
'yarn watch'

## Reference Code
I have used the tfjs pretrained model demo code for coco-ssd provided by Tensorflow.
